Write an integration that allows you to make copies of Dat archives on your own server via a chat bot (Slack, IRC, Messenger - it's up to you!). Bonus points if the Dats are available over a http gateway running on your server, and extra bonus points if only the Dats you've pinned on your server are available via your http gateway.
