All of our hacker spots have dual monitor set ups. Yes, thatâ€™s right, every hacker gets a dual monitor set up to work with! Make sure to bring either a display port, mini display port or HDMI cable. Other things we recommend you bring:

- A laptop & your chargers
- Toiletries
- Sleeping bag / blanket
- Anything else you want to hack on
