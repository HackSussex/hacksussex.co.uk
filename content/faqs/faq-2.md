Absolutely! If you don’t have a team before coming to the hack, that is no problem at all. Simply join the Slack channel, and have a chat with other attendees, and see if you can get a team sorted. If you are feeling particularly shy, feel free to talk to one of us, and we can try and sort out a team for you. We are aiming to provide a very friendly event, and we are happy to introduce you to everyone and anyone.
