Once you get to Brighton, there are two ways of getting to our campus. Either grab a train from Brighton station to Falmer, and it is a short walk from there. Alternatively, you may want to get a bus from Old Stiene, which is a short walk from Brighton station. From there, you can catch a 25 bus heading to “Universities”, and get off at North South Road when on Sussex University campus. 

If you’re worried about travelling to the event, please let us know and we can do our absolute best to help you along the way.
